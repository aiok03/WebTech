# WebTech
 Our final project is about education centre, where the user can register and then login into his account.
 
 
 The main function is proccessed after authorization, because after that "Teacher" page opens and user can see the list of teachers.
 In the search bar user can find the teacher according his name and contacts, and after that add it to the list of favourites. 
 In the "Dilnaz" zip file is the fully fixed design of our pages with language change, collapsible tabs, carousel, drop-dowm menus etc.
 In the "Aru" zip file is our functionality code. You can find the "server.js" file, where we adjusted the connection with other pages and post and get method.
 Also we created json files with categorized teachers list: IELTS, SAT, HSK, JLPT etc. 
 In order to run the files, first of all user should download our zip file from github and also download and install node.js, after that user should open command line and write 
 path to file, than write following statements: npm install nodemon ---> npm init ---> npm install express ---> npm install fs ---> npm install body-parser ---> node server.js 
 Than, in browser user should search for localhost:3001 or localhost:3001/teacher In the next times, if user wants to open web-site again he should write in command line only pair/three statements: path to file---> node server.js
